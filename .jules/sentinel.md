## 2024-05-18 - API Token Leakage in Internal Telemetry and Responses
**Vulnerability:** Machine identity tokens were being emitted unredacted to internal telemetry buses (potentially logging or monitoring tools) and also exposed directly in the `/api/identity/list` endpoint which returns a list of active machines.
**Learning:** In applications mapping active objects to in-memory databases (like `MACHINE_DB`), internal state objects usually represent the entire object, including secrets or credentials. It's unsafe to stream or expose this entire object without a redaction/sanitization step.
**Prevention:** Destructure and explicitly omit sensitive secrets like `token` from objects whenever they are being emitted for telemetry, logging, or sent as non-authenticated API responses.
